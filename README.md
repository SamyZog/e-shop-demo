<h2>E-shop demo</h2>

This is a small project built on top of the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is a small e-shop with different categories of items.

<h2 id="host">Hosting</h2>

This web app is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
  
<h2 id="dev-phase">Development phase</h2>

N.B: the /checkout, /favorites, /contact and /product/:slug routes are not yet finished.

I used the Fake Store API to get placeholder items for the demo.

The caching mechanism for the fetch requests is done using local storage, which is not ideal I know :), but the amount of data fetched is very small and this is just a small demo.

I used React's context API to control Cart and Favorites component logic.
