<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

This is my first ever project since I started learning front-end development.

It is made as a potfolio project to showcase to recruiters. 


<h2 id="dev-phase">Development phase</h2>

This was not a particularily difficult project to create.

The most time consuming aspect of the project was figuring out the file structure, maintinaining component re-usability and applying styling and responsiveness.

Concerning the app's functionality and logic, it was pretty straight-forward in implementation. By leveraging the SSR and SSG and the MovieDB API coupled with SWR's automatic request caching, it was an overall pleasant experience and I enjoyed my time working on it.
